# Issue #2: Navigation Functionality

## Requirements

Implement functional navigation for the glassmorphism navigation bar with proper routing and page structure.

**Key Requirements:**
- Embodi logo and home button should reset to first screen of signup page
- Blog and contact buttons should navigate to separate empty pages
- Maintain current page state and routing
- Preserve glassmorphism styling and animations
- Implement proper React routing structure

## Todos

### Phase 1: Routing Setup
- [x] Install React Router DOM if not already present
- [x] Set up basic routing structure in App.js
- [x] Create route components for different pages

### Phase 2: Page Components
- [x] Create Blog page component with glassmorphism styling
- [x] Create Contact page component with glassmorphism styling
- [x] Ensure all pages use the same background and navigation

### Phase 3: Navigation Logic
- [x] Implement home/logo click to reset signup form to initial state

- [x] Update Navigation component with proper routing links

### Phase 4: State Management
- [x] Ensure form state is properly managed across navigation
- [x] Handle form reset when returning to home

## Planning

### Technical Approach
- **React Router**: Use React Router DOM for client-side routing
- **Component Structure**: Create separate page components that include Navigation and content
- **State Management**: Use existing form state management, reset on home navigation
- **Styling Consistency**: Maintain glassmorphism theme across all pages

### Page Structure
```
/ (home) - Signup form page
/blog - Blog page (empty for now)
/contact - Contact page (empty for now)
```

### Dependencies
- React Router DOM
- Existing Navigation component
- Current form state management
- Glassmorphism styling system

### Success Criteria
- [x] Navigation links work correctly
- [x] Home/logo resets signup form to initial state
- [x] Blog and contact pages display with consistent styling
- [x] URL routing works properly
- [x] Form state is managed correctly across navigation
