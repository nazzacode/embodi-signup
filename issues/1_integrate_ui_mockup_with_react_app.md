# Issue #1: Integrate UI Mockup with React App

## Requirements

Convert/integrate the UI mockup in `ui_mockups/design2.html` into our functional React app while preserving existing functionality.

- Add background image and VR man illustration
- Preserve PWA capabilities and responsive design
- Keep configurable form system intact

- [x] Add background cover/center positioning
- [x] Ensure proper mobile responsive behavior
- [x] Update overall layout to match mockup positioning

### Phase 7: Configuration Updates
- [x] Update `form-config.js` with new color scheme
- [x] Add glassmorphism UI tokens
- [x] Update form content text to match mockup
- [x] Add terms disclaimer text

### Phase 8: Testing & Refinement
- [x] Test form functionality with new styling
- [x] Verify responsive design across devices
- [x] Test PWA capabilities still work
- [x] Ensure accessibility standards are maintained

### Phase 9: Second Stage Improvements (Completed)
- [x] Simplify second form stage - reduce visual overload
- [x] Replace text sections with thank you message and simplified explanation
- [x] Hide email textbox on second stage
- [x] Remove hints under text fields
- [x] Change submit button to 'Update'
- [x] Add spacing between name and phone text fields

## Planning

### Technical Approach
- **Preserve Existing Architecture**: Keep all existing components and functionality intact
- **Incremental Integration**: Apply styling changes component by component
- **Asset Management**: Use public folder for static assets to match mockup structure
- **CSS Strategy**: Extend existing Tailwind classes with custom styles for glassmorphism effects
- **Component Updates**: Modify existing components rather than creating new ones

### Key Design Elements to Implement
1. **Glassmorphism Effect**: backdrop-blur with semi-transparent backgrounds
2. **Color Scheme**: Dark backgrounds with white/gray text and transparent overlays
3. **Typography**: Maintain existing font stack with updated colors
4. **Interactive Elements**: Smooth hover transitions and focus states
5. **Layout**: Centered form with background image coverage

### Dependencies
- Existing React app structure and components
- Tailwind CSS for styling framework
- Public asset folder for images
- Current form configuration system

### Success Criteria
- [ ] UI matches the mockup design aesthetically
- [ ] All existing form functionality works unchanged
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile and desktop
- [ ] PWA features remain functional
- [ ] Performance is not significantly impacted
- [ ] Code maintainability is preserved
