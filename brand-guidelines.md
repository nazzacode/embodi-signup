# Embodi Computing - Brand Styling Guidelines

## Brand Context 
We are a spatial computing hardware startup building beautifully designed wearable hardware to enable healthy & productive spatial computing. 

## Design requirements
We want to replicate the look and feel of a cutting edge spatial/XR user interface (think Apple Vision OS) with our website. The overall feel should be like floating interface panels in a premium spatial computing environment - translucent, elegant, and futuristic while remaining highly functional.
- High tech, clean, minimal and modern.
- Main UI should be made up of translucent blured grey frames, white(ish) outlines and white(ish) text.
- We want a kind of " engineering blueprint" style with a major and minor background grid.


## Requested Features
- Centered header bar with the embodi text logo.
- 3D "rendered" grid background: like a blueprint, major and minor lines. The kind of thing you see in a 3d rendering of a building.
  - Next step: animate the grid lines to create a sense of depth and movement through space. 
- clearly defined color pallete.

## Brand Essence
- Futuristic XR computer user interface using blur transparency.
- Blueprint/technical-drawing/high-tech-architecture theme.
- Ultra High tech, clean, minimal, and modern
- Blur transparency: central element should have liquid glass blur (Apple liquid glass inspired).
- Healthtech/medical clean and sophisticated look.
<!-- - Interesting (cross-shaped?) bounding frames for elements? -->

## Color Pallete vibes
<!-- do some research and attach some images of examples -->
<!-- - Light/white: main background   -->
<!-- - Medium metallic grey: Logo -->
<!-- - Healthcare electric blue: primary gradient/accent (also green maybe?) -->
<!-- - Deep charcoal: primary text, strong contrast -->
<!-- - Medium grey: secondary text, subtitles -->

## Visual Design System
<!-- - background: start with medical a mainly white + blue/green/lightgrey? blured gradient. -->
<!-- - rounded corners: 0.5rem (8px) -->
<!-- - Logo text (Embodi Computing): You can style for now! show me what youve got, but it should be a high tech, clean, minimal, and modern design. -->

### Typography
<!-- - please keep keep to a consistent design system and put the fonts you are using here.  -->
<!-- - Use a modern, clean and minimal main sans-serif font. -->
<!-- - Use a modern take on a typewriter monospace fornt and as a secondary. -->
